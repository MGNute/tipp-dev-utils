Alignment has xxxALNPATTERNSxxx distinct alignment patterns

Found 0 invariant alignment patterns that correspond to 0 columns
Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: xxxPERCENTGAPSxxx

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 user-specified trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA+P-Invar

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.0010000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
