# tipp_dev_utils

A collection of files built over the years primarily for making reference packages for TIPP, but also for testing and evaluating TIPP performance.

*Dependencies*:
The stuff in these files have various dependencies which I have tried to compartmentalize by file where possible. However, there are a few major dependencies that they all share:
- [phylogeny_utilities](https://github.com/MGNute/phylogeny_utilities): my repo with utility functions accrued through graduate school, particularly the file 'utilities.py'
- [DendroPy](https://dendropy.org/)
- Numpy

Some scripts additionally depend on [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) and [Taxtastic](https://github.com/fhcrc/taxtastic)
