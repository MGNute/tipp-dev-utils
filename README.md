# tipp_dev_utils

A collection of files built over the years primarily for making reference packages for TIPP, but also for testing and evaluating TIPP performance.

*Dependencies*:
The stuff in these files have various dependencies which I have tried to compartmentalize by file where possible. However, there are a few major dependencies that they all share:
- phylogeny_utilities: my repo with utility functions accrued through graduate school, particularly the file 'utilities.py'
- dendropy
- numpy
